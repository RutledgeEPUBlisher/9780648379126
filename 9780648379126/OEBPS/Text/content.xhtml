    <h2 id="toc6" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Event: 1641 Massacre of the Planters</h2>

    <p>1641 - The Plantation of Ireland caused much resentment between the English-Scottish Planters and the native Irish population whom were now labourers or tenants on lands they once owned. This anger festered to such a state that gave rise an event in 1641 that would be remembered to this day and evermore. This event in question were the actions of the native Irish to cleanse Ireland of the newcomers once and for all. This Massacre of the Planters resulting in the &#160;slaughter of approximately 4000 Planters and thousands more died as a result of being displaced in the middle of winter.</p>

    <p>The English government under Charles I, whom coincidently was a Catholic, sent of an army to quell the violence, as did the Scottish parliament to help their fellow brethren. Local militias were mustered by locals to defend themselves in the absence of their governments support. The English Civil War, between the Royalist and Parliamentarians, brought the British troops back to England and left Ireland relatively peaceful. The Irish landholders at this stage still owned two-thirds of Ireland and the remaining to the Planters and Charles I.</p>

    <p>In the aftermath of the Massacre of the Planters Charles I signed an Adventures Act in parliament which allowed the repossession of lands and property of Irish rebels and gentry whom participated in these events to be transferred to &#160;Adventures<a id="bodyftn7" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn7">7</a> whom subscribed to the English parliament.</p>

    <p>Dissension was prevalent during Charles I reign. He tried to force English Anglicism upon the Scottish Presbyterians &#160;leading to the Bishop's Wars. Conflicts with his own Parliamentarians over increasing tax revenue and flexing his Royal authority over government leading to the English Civil War. The issues surrounding the aforementioned Massacre of the Planters was not resolved. Protestant Planters in Ulster were divided by those whom supported the Parliament and those Loyalist of the Crown. The Irish also formed their own Catholic Confederation government in the absence of Charles I support of Irish rights. In the end the tyranny of Charles I capitulated in his execution by the the English Parliament. Thence Oliver Cromwell's The New Model Army marched throughout England, Scotland and Ireland to assert his English-Protestant reforms.</p>

    <p>Cromwell's army served in Ireland between 1649-1654 with 20000 men. Rutledge's whom served Cromwell as Officers known as The ''Forty-Nine'' Officers<a id="bodyftn9" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn9">9</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="toc11" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Event: 1691 The Glorious Revolution</h2>

    <p>William of Orange, a Protestant noble from Holland, began his accession in 1685. James II, an English king of Catholic faith, were seen to be a threat to Protestant control in England and Ireland. William of Orange was invited by the English Parliament to reign jointly with James II daughter Mary, whom was a Protestant . William was already engaged in a struggle with Louis XIV of France and an experienced leader in battle. Ireland became a major theatre of war in 1690-91. William's victory over James II at the Boyne in July 1690 were reinforced by the Williamite victory at Aughrim in July 1691. &#160;King William of Orange's victory at the Battle of the Boyne is still celebrated in Northern Ireland every July 12th with controversial marches &#160;by Unionist ''Orange men.'' &#160;The aftermath of this victory was that &#160;thousands of Irish soldiers fled to Europe and control of much of the land in Catholic hands passed to what would become known as the Protestant Ascendancy. There were Rutledge's whom suffered losses as a result of supporting their English King instead of the English Parliament. In the west of Ireland, Galway was a trading port with wealthy merchants trading with Spain, with the local Irish, as well as the English government. The Parliament put up a naval blockade in Ireland to counter the Spanish-French treat which resulted in many merchants in Galway unable to trade thus suffer financially. This is one of the reasons why the Rutledge's in the west of Ireland joined the fight against the Parliamentarians. Unfortunately the Rutledge's in Galway suffered further losses of landholdings under the Williamite Confiscations.</p>

    <p>Paul Rutledge, Lieutenant<a id="bodyftn20" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn20">20</a>, served under Colonel Henry Dillon's Regiments of Infantry in support for King James II, the Catholic King of England. He had lands confiscated.</p>

    <p>Lieutenant Paul Rutledge. &#160;In 1676 a Thomas Rutledge had a confirmatory grant of 139 acres in Tipperary, while this officer is described, in the Inquisition taken on his Attainder, as 'of Clontikilty, County Mayo.' &#160;A James Rutledge, on the same roll of outlawries, was possessed of property in the town of Galway of which Catherine Rutledge, otherwise Blake, claimed and was allowed jointure. A Lieutenant Edward 'Rutledge' &#160;was one of the '1649' &#160;officers.<a id="bodyftn21" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn21">21</a></p>

    <p>The Jacobite is simply an Englishman who professes the faith of Legitimism, a member of the English branch of a catholic or universal party. The Jacobites attempted to restore James II to the English throne, to restore the Stuarts to the Scottish throne, and to restore land and rights to the Catholics in Ireland. This would have brought &#160;England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales under the ultimate authority of the Pope in Rome, but the outcome was that the Anglican English Parliament came out the strongest and dominant. &#160;</p>

    <p class="standard2">Rutledge 'Jacobite' Tree.</p>

    <p>1. James Rutledge, Esq., of the family of Rutledge of the province of Connaught. as previously mentioned in the Glorious Revolution, served the Catholic King James II against the Protestants of William of Orange. James's son Walter, now living in France where he was a shipowner, followed in his fathers footsteps in aiding the Catholic cause in Ireland and to restore the family merchant business. Married Dame Juliana Blake, daughter of Sir Thomas Blake, Knight Baronet.</p>

    <p>I. WALTER RUTLEDGE, 'armateur<a id="bodyftn22" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn22">22</a>,' of Dunkirk, son of James Rutledge, Esq., of the family of Rutledge of the province of Connaught, by Dame Juliana Blake, daughter of Sir Thomas Blake, Knight Baronet [I], had on 5th July 1745 a declaration of his noblesse from King James III and VIII, and on 23rd December 1748 was created by the same King for his services to Charles, Prince of Wales, a KNIGHT and BARONET [I], with remainder to the heirs-male of his body.<a id="bodyftn23" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn23">23</a></p>

    <p>3. JAMES or JOHN JAMES (1743–1794), publicist, was the grandson of an Irish Jacobite who settled in France, and was son of Walter Rutledge (d. 1779), a banker and shipowner at Dunkirk, who assisted the Pretender in his expedition of 1715, and was consequently created a baronet by him. James accordingly styled himself 'chevalier' or 'baronet.' Born, probably at Dunkirk, in 1743, he was brought up to speak both French and English. He entered, without pay, Berwick's Franco-Irish cavalry regiment; but on its being disbanded in 1762 he returned to Dunkirk, where he married a shipowner's daughter. In 1772 his father-in-law's embarrassments induced him to go to Paris, with a view to selling his reversionary interest in his father's property near Rheims; but his father's want of affection for him, the rapacity of his stepmother and her children, and the dishonesty of a notary reduced the proceeds, he asserted, to a very small sum. Thenceforth he lived by his pen, and he did much to make English literature known in France. He did not indeed, as is stated by the 'Biographie Universelle,' assist in Letourneur's translation of Shakespeare, for he criticised that translation as inaccurate; but in 'Observations à l'Académie' (1776) he extolled Shakespeare, in reply to Voltaire, as far superior to French dramatists. He wrote a long letter to Goldsmith, accompanied by an imitation in French of a portion of the 'Deserted Village,' and published this, with Goldsmith's reply. In 1783 he was cast in damages at the suit of the notary, Deherain, whom he had libelled, and, in default of payment, was imprisoned. The revolution gave scope for his mania for delation. He charged Necker with a conspiracy to deprive Paris of bread, covered the walls of Paris with denunciations of him, became the spokesman of the bakers in their grievances against the millers, and in November 1789 was arrested on the charge of usurpation of powers, in proposing to raise a loan for the bakers on easier terms than those offered by the municipality. Released in the following January, he renewed his scurrilous attacks on Necker and his family. He was a leading member of the Cordeliers' Club till his expulsion in November 1791; but in 1790 he was refused admission to the Jacobin Club, then consisting mainly of moderate men, on account of his calumniating disposition. After the death, on 13 July 1793, of Marat, who had applauded his denunciations, he seems to have fallen into obscurity, but was imprisoned by the committee of general security in the following October. His death, in March 1794, passed unnoticed except in the necrology of the Petites Affiches.</p>

    <p>Rutledge's numerous productions include: 1. 'Thamar: tragédie,' 1769, 8vo. 2. 'Mémoire sur le caractère et les mœurs des Français comparés à ceux des Anglais,' 1776, 8vo. 3. 'La Quinzaine Anglaise,' London, 1776, 8vo; this sketch, which depicts the rapidity with which a 'plunger' may be reduced to destitution by the harpies of Paris and purports to be a posthumous work by Sterne, to whose works it bears no sort of resemblance, was translated as 'The Englishman's Fortnight in Paris,' by 'An Observer,' Dublin, 1771. The writer states that attempts had been made to suppress the work in Paris. A species of sequel, entitled 'Le Second Voyage de milord -,' appeared in 1779. 4. 'Le Train de Paris, ou les Bourgeois du Tours,' 1777, 8vo. 5. 'Les Comédiens ou le Foyer: comédie,' 1777. 6. 'Le Babillard,' 1778, an imitation of the 'Tatler.' 7. 'Calypso,' 1784–5. 8.

    <p>1768 - Lt. Don Melchor Rutledge, Regimento De Hibernia, Spanish Army<a id="bodyftn25" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn25">25</a></p>

    <p>Regimento de Infanteria de Hibernia was formed in 1703 from soldiers and reformed officers obtained through France. <a id="bodyftn26" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn26">26</a>. &#160;The monarchy of Spain in this year was under Charles III of Spain whom is related to the king of France</p>

    <p>The Rutledge's in Galway, as previously mentioned, were prosperous merchants trading with French and Spanish traders. The Rutledge's in this region can be deemed as having strong, high ranking, &#160;foreign connections. There is one Rutledge whom were recorded as a doctor to the King of Spain. This book in the Linen Hall Library in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was written in Spanish.</p>

    <p>It would be worth noting that There were prominent Rutledge's in America whom were involved in politics involving Spain, France, and &#160;Great Britain. &#160;Dr Charles Rutledge was known to have been travelling back to America from Spain in 1799. His father John Rutledge was a Governor of South Carolina, which had been a former Spanish colony. Perhaps this was the doctor in reference to.</p>

    <p>A third options is that after the Jacobite loss to the Williamites in 1691, many Irish fled Ireland, known as 'The Flight of The Wild Geese', and joined the military service of many European armies. Spain and France were the most favoured options.</p>

    <h2 id="toc18" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Event: 1800s Potato Famine</h2>

    <p>The Great Potato Famine 1845-49 was caused by a fungus that destroyed Ireland's main food crop. Roughly a million people starved to death or died of related diseases. The death toll and misery was exasperated by the lowest in human nature with the atrocious stories about heartless landholders whom evicted their Irish tenants leaving whole families to perish on the side of the roads or in the bogs. There were however many whom provided assistance to their fellow countrymen. County Mayo being the worst affected area, there were landlords who kept their tenants with work and food, Public relief was in good nature intended to help but severely lacking funding, and of course departing on 'coffin ships' carried the sick and starving famine survivors across the oceans in hope of a new life</p>

    <p>George Rutledge, Brabazon Park, Swinford, enclosing a memorial from the Board of Guardians of Swinford Poor Law Union, requesting public works to alleviate distress following the failure of the potato crop. Date: &#160;28/01/1846 &#160;, County: &#160;Mayo<a id="bodyftn31" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn31">31</a></p>

    <p>William Rutledge, chairman of the Knock Relief Committee, requesting three hundred poor relief tickets. Date: 27/07/1846 , County: Mayo , Barony: Clanmorris<a id="bodyftn32" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn32">32</a></p>

    <h2 id="toc19" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Event: 1800s Irish Diaspora</h2>

    <p>The Potato Famine and Land inheritance attributed en-mass to the Irish Diaspora. Before the famine, land was subdivided with each male receiving a piece of the family estate, which grew smaller with each generation. After the famine, the oldest son got the estate and the younger siblings emigrated abroad.</p>

    <p>'Coffin ships' gained their reputation as many of the ships contracted to take the desperate immigrants were barely seaworthy, or no longer fit for dependable commerce. The poor were weak from starvation and vulnerable to ''famine fever,'' which spread to others in the putrid, cramped holds of these awful ships. Many who lived through the six-to-eight-week journey died shortly after reaching their new country.</p>

    <p>Shipping records of their Passenger List detail the desperate, the brave, the willing, and the able, whom all took their chances on a new life in the New Worlds that of America, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Passenger Lists can be found in the following chapters of each country.</p>

    <h2 id="toc22" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Event: 1816-1922 Royal Irish &#160;Constabulary</h2>

    <p>The Royal Irish Constabulary, as it was named from the time of the Fenian rising of 1867, differed in many ways from the normal county police force found elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It was under the direct control of the central government and was essentially a gendarmerie, or semi-military police force. With the exception of the Dublin Metropolitan area, the RIC policed the country. Unlike the Irish Constabulary, the DMP was an unarmed force</p>

    <p>Though the political troubles, from 1916 onwards, brought with them further and disturbing changes in the composition of the force. The remarkable fact remains that a gendarmerie, composed of so large a proportion of Roman Catholics, provided a mainstay of government in Ireland throughout the greater part of the 19th century. The reality of the history of the Royal Irish Constabulary must be of direct significance for any full understanding of the shaping of public opinion and political awareness. The police, of course, had a wide range of duties beyond the 'political' ones, but its history must be considered as a whole.</p>

    <p>Members of the Force, who were mainly Catholics, were recruited from the tenant-farmer class and were removed to distant stations. The RIC was unpopular in many areas because it was used to assist at evictions and owing to the discontented state of the country throughout most of the 19th century, and the early part of the 20th century it filled a semi-military role.</p>

    <p>The RIC became unpopular following the land agitations of the late 19th century. Following the Land War, the era of the Auxiliaries and the Black and Tans, the resignations from the Force were to see the end of the Royal Irish Constabulary which was disbanded in 1922.</p>

    <p>83743 members passed through the Constabulary ranks up to 1922.</p>

    <p>549 members of the RIC were killed on duty as a result of political violence and other means between 1916 and 1922.</p>

    <p>316 members of the RIC were awarded the Constabulary Medal between 1842 and 1922.</p>

    <p>43 members were awarded the King's Police Medal between 1909 and 1922. <a id="bodyftn35" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn35">35</a></p>

    <p>Nationalists wanted Ireland to govern itself and believed in would be in the best interest of the people in Ireland to have their own government free of the oppressive British government in Westminister. Patrick J. Ruttledge was a member of the political party Sinn Féin from 1921-1923 before going on to be a founding member of the Fianna Fáil. Whilst in service of the Irish republic he was the temporary head of the party when Éamon de Valera &#160;was imprisoned, served as Minister for Lands &amp; Fisheries, Minister for Justice and Minister for Local Government and Public Health. Patrick was buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin, and this is his tombstone inscription.</p>

    <h2 id="toc32" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Origins of the double 'tt' surnamed Ruttledge</h2>

    <p>A Ruttledge is still a Rutledge as are all variations of this unique surname. The Ruttledges with double 't' came about by design by the highly literate folk in Ireland. &#160;The Ruttledge surname was taken up officially in Ireland during 1800's even though it has been in use in England and Scotland since the early 1600's.</p>

    <p>The surname Ruttledge &#160;and crest was assumed to carry on as a branch of the Rutledge name. There were two instances when the name was officially taken up by those marrying into a Rutledge family.</p>

    <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Origins of the Irish Rutledges</h2>

    <p>History in general and the history of surnames must be looked at in their broader context. The surname Rutledge in Ireland has many variations in origins. There were folk of English origin who landed in Ireland in the 1600s. Indigenous Irish who were forced to Anglicise or adopt English names under the Penal Code. Those whom opted to change their name to an English name to perhaps improve their future employment prospects in the British-American Empire. Then of course there are those whom married into the family name. Remember that the name Rutledge or Red Letch is a place name referring to a particular group of people who lived near the streams where the stones appeared red. As with the Rutledge name in Ireland, it may refer to the people who joined the Rutledge clan.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Mulderrig (O' Maoildeirg)</h3>

    <p>The Irish surname Mulderrig, or the older Irish Gaelic version O'Maoildeirg, was Anglicised under the surname Rutledge. It is believed that the name Mulderrig originated in county Donegal and grew into the northern parts of county Mayo. The name Mulderrig in county Mayo also goes by the synonym surname of Reid and Reddington. What these names have in common is that it refers to 'red chief/s' <a id="bodyftn62" href="../Text/content.xhtml#ftn62">62</a> or a more descriptively translated as 'red-haired chiefs' of Nordic ancestry.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>O'Maoildeirg is an Irish name whence broken down into 'O' meaning male descendant of, 'maol' or 'mal' is chief, and 'derig' or 'dearg' meaning red.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Reddington is of Anglo-Saxon origin which directly translates as 'Redd' as in the colour red - hair or complexion, 'ing' meaning people of, and 'ton' meaning town. Which in turn means the red-haired people from the town, or the town with red-haired people.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Reid in Old English is 'read' or red, and the Irish equivalent for the colour red is 'deirg' as in Muldeirg. The name could also come from the Norman surname 'le Reid' which describes the red colour of hair or complexion of the face. Another alternative source is that of the Scots Gaelic name Ruadh which means red. Without a doubt this name is describing the physical characteristics of the incoming people whom settled their lands.</p>

    <p>The transition from Gaelic Ireland adapting various elements of the language of the Angles, Scottish, and Normans. The local population whom assumed the name Rutledge which itself comes from the colour Red and the waterway Letch.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p>As an act of respect for the Irish Gaelic culture there were individuals preserving the history of the people and their culture. From their translations we are fortunate enough to see a glimpse of the names of the Irish people before they assumed English names during the times of the Protestant Ascendency.</p>

    <p>CAVAN SPRING ASSIZES</p>

    <p>SPOTTEN a. RUTLEDGE</p>

    <p>This was an appeal from a decision of the Assistant Barrister at last October sessions.</p>

    <p>Mr. JOHNSTON stated the case--It was an action for 10l. for an I O U for loss sustained in consequence of a house purchased by applicant and plaintiff on a certain farm being let go to wreck, and another detained for a year and a half, contrary to agreement.</p>

    <p>Alexander WALSH examined by Mr. JOHNSTON--Knows Mr. SPOTTEN, is his attorney; recollects agreement between SPOTTEN and Mr. RUTLEDGE about certain lands. On that occasion MR. SPOTTEN made an objection that there were parties residing on the lands, who could not then give up possession; got on that occasion an I O U for 10l., as a warrant that their houses would be delivered up to 6th May following; this affair occurred in April.</p>

    <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ARMSTRONG--The I O U was a guarantee for surrender of houses belonging to the cottiers on the farm.</p>

    <p>To the court--The consideration money was paid in five springers and 19l. of money, making up the entered sum of 47l. the stipulated purchase money.</p>

    <p>James SPOTTEN, the plaintiff, examined by Mr. JOHNSON--Recollects the two houses on the lands bought by him; got possession of the lands in April but did not get the houses for nearly a year and a half after that, one of them was then down; offered RUTLEDGE, if he put up the house, to give him his I O U; would give 20l. less for the farm without that house than with it.</p>

    <p>To the court--They were mud-wall houses thatched, with two rooms in each.</p>

    <p>[Examination and cross-examination of Robert M'AULEY, who was Mr. SPOTTEN's herd at the time and knew the house occupied by SMYTH and KELAHER; also of Mr. Thomas JOHNSTON and Owen SMITH]</p>

    <p>&#160;His Lordship said it was a serious question whether the action was sustainable in point of law. The body of the I O U is absolute, and the condition is merely a memorandum of the witness....The would, therefore, affirm the dismiss with costs.</p>

    <p>2. The Bawn</p>

    <p>On part of what was called Bawnboy Demense the large 33 acre field in front of Bawnboy House was called `The Lawn'. Tradition tells us that this land was once Magauran strongholds. It was confiscated under the terms of the Ulster Plantation, 1609. Two brothers, Sir Richard and Sir George Greames, sons of George senior from the Scottish border were each given 1000 acres in Bawnboy and the surrounding area.</p>

    <p>In a report dated August 1622, it is stated that Sir Richard Greames holds 1000 acres on which is built a bawne of stone and Iyme, 60 foot square and 9 foot high, with a little stone house within, where in Lieut. William Ruttledge dwelleth and hath a lease thereof and of 200 acres of land for 21 years. The rest of Sir Richard's 1000 acres are set to the Irish from yeare to yeare, who plough after ye Irish fashion.</p>

    <p>Part of the bawn and castle may still be seen to the left hand side of the avenue, which leads to the old GAA grounds. The bawn wears a heavy coat of ivy.</p>
